# IUDIS
Integrated University Department Information System

The Integrated University Departmental Information System is a smaller
part of the larger university system that will interact with the budget
system and the database system for the computer science department. The
IUDIS is concerned with the users of the IUDIS, such as students,
professors, advisors, other officials, and third party goods/service
providers. The goal of the IUDIS is to please the user by having fast
loading, easy to read, clearly arranged, and seamless navigation to all
pages.  Other factors that may affect the system is the load, the hard
disk space, and the amount of down time the server faces. This product
may be appear to be a combination of NYU’s Albert and Bursar systems.
